### ðŸ“Œ **Type of Triangle**
  
Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

- Equilateral: It's a triangle with ***3*** sides of equal length.
- Isosceles: It's a triangle with ***2*** sides of equal length.
- Scalene: It's a triangle with ***3*** sides of differing lengths.
- Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

**Input Format**

The TRIANGLES table is described as follows:

![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/12887/1443815629-ac2a843fb7-1.png)

Each row in the table denotes the lengths of each of a triangle's three sides.

**Sample Input**

![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/12887/1443815827-cbfc1ca12b-2.png)

**Sample Output**

    Isosceles
    Equilateral
    Scalene
    Not A Triangle
    
**Answer**
```sql
SELECT
 CASE 
  WHEN (A + C <= B)  OR  (A + B <= C) OR (B + C <= A) THEN 'Not A Triangle'
  WHEN (A = B) AND (B = C) THEN 'Equilateral'
  WHEN (A =B) OR (C = A) OR (B = C) THEN 'Isosceles'
  ELSE 'Scalene'
 END
FROM TRIANGLES;
```

### ðŸ“Œ **The PADS**
  
Generate the following two result sets:

1. Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in **OCCUPATIONS**, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).
   
2. Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in **OCCUPATIONS**. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:

       There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.
where [occupation_count] is the number of occurrences of an occupation in OCCUPATIONS and [occupation] is the lowercase occupation name. If more than one Occupation has the same [occupation_count], they should be ordered alphabetically.

**Note:** There will be at least two entries in the table for each type of occupation.

**Input Format**

The  **OCCUPATIONS** table is described as follows:

![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/12889/1443816414-2a465532e7-1.png)

Occupation will only contain one of the following values: Doctor, Professor, Singer or Actor.

**Sample Input**

An OCCUPATIONS table that contains the following records:

 CONCAT(NAME,
 CASE
  WHEN OCCUPATION LIKE "Doc%" THEN "(D)"
  WHEN OCCUPATION LIKE "Act%" THEN "(A)"
  WHEN OCCUPATION LIKE "Sing%" THEN "(S)"
  WHEN OCCUPATION LIKE "Prof%" THEN "(P)"
 END
)
FROM OCCUPATIONS
ORDER BY NAME ASC;

SELECT
 CONCAT('There are a total of ', COUNT(OCCUPATION), ' ', 
 CASE 
  WHEN LOWER(OCCUPATION) LIKE '%s' THEN LOWER(OCCUPATION)
  ELSE CONCAT(LOWER(OCCUPATION), 's')
 END, '.') AS summary
FROM OCCUPATIONS 
GROUP BY OCCUPATION
ORDER BY COUNT(OCCUPATION) ASC, OCCUPATION ASC;
```
    
### ðŸ“Œ **Binary Tree Nodes**
  
You are given a table, BST, containing two columns: N and P, where N represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and P is the parent of N.

![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/12888/1443818507-5095ab9853-1.png)

Write a query to find the node type of Binary Tree ordered by the value of the node. Output one of the following for each node:

- Root: If node is root node.
- Leaf: If node is leaf node.
- Inner: If node is neither root nor leaf node.
  
**Sample Input**

![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/12888/1443818467-30644673f6-2.png)

**Sample Output**

	1 Leaf
	2 Inner
	3 Leaf
	5 Root
	6 Leaf
	8 Inner
	9 Leaf
    
**Explanation**
The Binary Tree below illustrates the sample:

```sql
SELECT
 N,
 CASE
  WHEN P IS NULL THEN 'Root'
  WHEN N IN (SELECT P FROM BST) THEN 'Inner'
  ELSE 'Leaf'

### ðŸ“Œ **New Companies**

Given the table schemas below, write a query to print the company_code, founder name, total number of lead managers, total number of senior managers, total number of managers, and total number of employees. Order your output by ascending company_code.

**Note:**
* The tables may contain duplicate records.
* The company_code is string, so the sorting should not be **numeric**. For example, if the company_codes are C_1, C_2, and C_10, then the ascending company_codes will be C_1, C_10, and C_2.
